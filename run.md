To run the application, you have to have Java 10 installed on your PC.
At the moment the project is built in IntelliJ (I don't have a Maven/Ant/Gradle build file), and that's why I have uploaded a built jar file.

windows:
java -jar out\artifacts\NumericalOptimizationPlatform\_jar\NumericalOptimizationPlatform.jar

linux:
java -jar out/artifacts/NumericalOptimizationPlatform\_jar/NumericalOptimizationPlatform.jar
